This is a test project I implemented to begin learning the Spring framework. Utilizes in-memory user management, and was intended to be a system for creating and maintaining maintenance tickets for a small facility.

This is in no way optimized, and there are many things I would've changed if I knew them at the time.

### Launch locally
To launch the Tomcat server locally:
`mvn spring-boot:run`

The application will be available at http://localhost:8080 by default after install finishes.
